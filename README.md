# Denoising Autoencoder Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Denoising.ipynb`) demonstrating the use of Circulant Toeplitz Matrices for denoising.
## Project Overview

Circulant Toeplitz Matrices (CTMs) may remove noise from input data and restore the original data. The primary goals of this project include:

- Understanding the structure of CTMs and their application in denoising tasks.
- Visualizing the denoising results and evaluating the performance of the model.

The notebook contains sections covering data preparation, model architecture, matrix design, and evaluation.

## Files in the Repository

- **Denoising.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the Denoising model.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, the following Python libraries are required:

- `scipy`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `PIL`

You can install the required libraries using pip.
